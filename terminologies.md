## REST (REpresentational State Transfer)
- REST is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems


## URI vs URL
- All URLs are URIs, as every URL can only contain the location.
- All URIs cannot be URLs, as they can tell either name or location.	

- URI contains two subsets, URN, which tell the name, and URL, which tells the location.	
- URL is the subset of URI, which tells the only location of the resource.
