## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
 
  * The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a part of Ethereum.
  It controls smart contract deployment and execution.
  Itâ€™s the ecosystem in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live.
  The EVM is what describes the guidelines for computing a new valid state from block to block.

  * The EVM running on the Ethereum blockchain may be thought of as a global decentralized computer at a high level.
  * Each and every node of the network running the EVM and executing the same instructions.
