### Overview
Essentially a number-guessing game

On average block is added about every 10 minutes

Every block contains bitcoin transactions as data

### Terminologies
Hash target: A 256-bit number, the "problem"

Nonce: A 32-bit number, the "solution" to the problem

Mining: the process of finding nonce

Miners: nodes in the network doing mining work

### Hash target
Is a pre-determined number

Miners try to guess a *nonce* (number only used once) so that the block's hash value is less than the target hash

Basically target hash with more leading 0s -> more difficulty

Changes every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) with ensured difficulty (so that on average a block is added about every **10 minutes**)

### Block reward
Miners who create new blocks are rewarded

Originally 50 BTC for every block mined

Halving every 210000 blocks (about 4 years)

Currently 6.25 BTC for every block
